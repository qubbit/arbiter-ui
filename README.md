UI for creating and manipulating business rules


Development
-----------

Install `yarn` if it is not already. Usually this can be as simple as doing

```
npm install --global yarn
```

If the above command does not work, refer to https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install

Now that you have `yarn` installed, `cd` into this repo directory and run `yarn` and then `yarn start`

Go to `http://localhost:1234` in your browser (port binding can be changed in `package.json`)
